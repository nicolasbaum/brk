/// Trait for types that can be serialized to/from bytes with explicit byte order.

/// This trait uses **LITTLE-ENDIAN** byte order for all numeric types, making the data
/// **portable across different endianness systems** (x86, ARM, etc.). This is the key
/// difference from `ZeroCopyVec`, which uses native byte order and is not portable.
///
/// Use this trait when:
/// - You need cross-platform compatibility
/// - You're sharing data between systems with different endianness
/// - You need custom serialization logic
///
/// For maximum performance on a single system, use `ZeroCopyVec` instead.

    /// in-memory representation of Self. When true, bulk operations can use
    /// memcpy instead of per-element deserialization.
